# 📊 Case Study: Bitcoin (BTC) vs. S&P 500

Welcome to my investment case study analyzing the performance of **Bitcoin (BTC)** compared to the **S&P 500** index. This project was created as part of my data analytics portfolio to explore the risks and returns of traditional vs. crypto assets using real data.

## 📌 Objective

To evaluate whether Bitcoin or the S&P 500 would have been a better investment over a selected time period, based on historical performance metrics such as:

- Cumulative returns
- Volatility
- Sharpe Ratio
- Correlation

## 🧰 Tools Used

- **R & R Markdown**
- **Tidyverse**
- **ggplot2**
- **Quantmod / Tidyquant**
- **Yahoo Finance data**

## 📁 Project Structure

## 🔍 Key Findings (Preview)

- Bitcoin had higher **cumulative returns**, but with **greater volatility**
- S&P 500 was more **stable**, with lower risk-adjusted returns
- The **Sharpe Ratio** favored BTC in certain periods, but not consistently
- Diversification between BTC and S&P 500 could improve portfolio efficiency

*Note: Full findings are in the notebook.*
